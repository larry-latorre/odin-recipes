    <h3>Fudge Cake</h3>
    <p>
      A small fudge cake is a rich and indulgent dessert that packs an intense
      chocolate flavor into a compact size. This moist and decadent cake is
      typically made with high-quality cocoa powder, melted chocolate, butter,
      sugar, eggs, and flour. The result is a dense and fudgy texture that melts
      in your mouth. Often, small fudge cakes are baked in individual portions,
      making them perfect for single servings or sharing. They are commonly
      enjoyed warm, with a gooey center, and may be topped with a dusting of
      powdered sugar, a scoop of vanilla ice cream, or a drizzle of chocolate
      ganache for an extra touch of sweetness. Small fudge cakes are a
      delightful treat for chocolate lovers and are often served on special
      occasions or as a comforting dessert to satisfy sweet cravings.
